# Cats-Dogs-Image-Classification-SVM-CNN
 -Image classification of Cats and Dogs using SVM and CNN models. <br />
 -These models were created as a part of a research paper on "Comparative Analysis of SVM and CNN in Image Classification". <br />
 -Both the models were trained and tested with a subset of cats and dogs of 4000 images. <br />
 -The CNN model was trained and tested with 20,000 images. <br />
 -The accuracy of the models is the following: <br /> <br />

 <table>

 -The paper will be published in the upcoming conference, IEEE NMITCON-2023.
