# Cats-Dogs-Image-Classification-SVM-CNN
 -Image classification of Cats and Dogs using SVM and CNN models.
 -These models were created as a part of a research paper on "Comparative Analysis of SVM and CNN in Image Classification".
 -Both the models were trained and tested with a subset of cats and dogs of 4000 images.
 -The CNN model was trained and tested with 20,000 images.
 -The accuracy of the models is the following:
 
 |          | CNN 20,000 | CNN 4,000 | SVM 4,000 |
 | Accuracy |    89%     |    76%    |    61%    |
 | Loss     |    26%     |    50%    |     -     |

 -The paper will be published in the upcoming conference, IEEE NMITCON-2023.
